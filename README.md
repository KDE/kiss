# KDE Initial System Setup (KISS)

The Out-of-the-box (OOTB) experience that greets a user after system
installation or when starting up a new computer. Guides the user in creating the
system's first user account and configuring initial settings.


## Features

- User account creation
- Language selection
- Keyboard layout selection
- Time zone selection
- Network configuration


## Getting Started

> [!caution]
> It is not recommended to install this on your system â€” you should use a virtual machine instead. Installing this on real hardware will leave behind files not trivially uninstallable and could leave your system in a non-function state.

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kiss.git
```

- Build and install:

```bash
cmake -B build/
cmake --build build/ --parallel
sudo cmake --install build/
```

- Trigger system user creation:

```bash
sudo systemd-sysusers
```

- Enable the systemd service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable kde-initial-system-setup.service
```

- Reboot:

With the systemd service enabled, reboot your system and the initial setup will run automatically.
